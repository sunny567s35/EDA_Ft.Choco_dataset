# Exploratory Data Analysis ( EDA )
## EDA 
- The main purpose of EDA is to help look at data before making any assumptions.
-  It can help identify obvious errors, as well as better understand patterns within the data, detect outliers or anomalous events, find interesting relations among the variables.
-  Data scientists can use exploratory analysis to ensure the results they produce are valid and applicable to any desired business outcomes and goals. 
-  EDA also helps stakeholders by confirming they are asking the right questions. 
-  EDA can help answer questions about standard deviations, categorical variables, and confidence intervals. 
-  Once EDA is complete and insights are drawn, its features can then be used for more sophisticated data analysis or modeling, including machine learning.
